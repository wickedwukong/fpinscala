Hi everyone,

Thanks for all the feedback and suggestions throughout this (lengthy) process. We've now completed drafts of all chapters of the book, and have just completed a pass through the book making numerous revisions. Chapter 13 is still being actively revised, but aside from chapter 13, we're relatively happy with the structure and content of the other chapters and will be looking to you to tell us if something isn't working or if you really don't like something.

For part 3, we are particularly interested in getting feedback on a few things. If you've completed the exercises in Part 1, and worked through at least one or two of the part 2 chapters, did you find the introduction of more abstract structures like monads approachable? Were the exercises easy, hard? Were they interesting? Although we made the exercises an integral part of the book, we're also curious to know how well the Part 3 and Part 4 content works for you if you maybe haven't done as many of the exercises or engaged as actively with the book content.

And after finishing part 4, do you feel like you have a relatively complete picture of how to approach writing functional programs that interact with the outside world? Do you feel like you have a solid foundation for approaching programming tasks in a functional way, and for learning more about different areas of FP that you encounter in your work?

There are still a number of issues / bugs on the [GitHub issues][]. We'll be making a pass through all those after this final review to make sure all issues get addressed or considered.
